            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This variation on Blood on the Clocktower has the gimmick of deciding roles by asking its players 2 questions, answered from 1 to 5, before starting the match. 
                Depending on how your answers are similar / different to your fellow players decides whether you become a Townsfolk, Outsider or Minion/Demon.
                The storyteller should aim to pick the Minions & Demon as a group of players with opinions dissimilar to majority but, ideally, similar to each other.
                Outsiders should be people with an opinion dissimilar to the majority, but not necessarily similar to each other. Townsfolk is everyone who wasn't classified
                as strange in some way!

                Question = Asked on the survey at the beginning of the game<br>
                Opinion = The value someone gave to one of the questions<br>
                Good Opinion = An opinion held by a townsfolk<br>
                Evil Opinion = An opinion held by a minion or demon<br>
                Someone is "unusual" = They are either an outsider, minion, demon or opinion has registered as like an outsider, minion or demon.
				If there are two or more minions, the demon should be the player with the middle of the evil opinions.
